# Launch-Site-SpaceX-Success-Failure
# The project is conducted to determine how much it is going to cost if the first stage of rocket landing will be successful.
  Here, we will use different methodologies to determine the results and find the best possible answer to our problem 
  i.e., an est. cost to send a rocket to space is 165million dollars but if the first stage is successful the cost is relatively less. 
  So, the aim of this project is to find whether the first stage of the rocket will be successful considering all the parameters.
	
  Data sets were collected from the skill network labs from Coursera. Some of the data sets were collected via web scrapping and using REST api.
  Data used for Geo locations of the launch sites was taken from SpaceX Api from the SpaceX website.
	
  Beautiful Soup method was used to extract data from the web by putting a GET request and using BeautifulSoup to put the data in the variable.
	
  To process the data and get the result, we need to add the column in the data frame such as class where we take values from outcome column 
  where 0 represents the failure of the first stage and 1 represents the success. This makes it easy to predict the data and give us the desired result.
	
  Scatter plots, bar plots and Line plots were used to see the relationship between different parameters for data visualization.
	
  When doing Predictive analysis, we tested all four classifications model to see which one had better accuracy but it seems all four of them have equal accuracy.
